This is a jQuery plugin that helps developers who make business management solutions and POS systems using web technologies.

It catches the barcode scanner's output and gives to you as a parameter of a function.

The plugin recognizes the barcode scanner's header characters to prevent the catch of a keyboard's output.

Plesa visit the [setup](setup.md) page to know how setup correctly the plug-in.
